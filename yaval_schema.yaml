# This yaml doc has meaning on two separate levels:
#   1. It defines the structure of yaval schemas.
#   2. It serves as an example of a yaval schema, because it defines
#      its own structure according to yaval rules. In other words,
#      the yaval schema is, itself, a yaval schema.
# This overloaded, recursive sort of structure can get a bit confusing, but
# don't get lost in the details. It's simpler than it looks.

# What is the minimum version of the yaval spec that this schema validates
# against? The expectation is that this schema (doc) should validate against
# any version of the spec that has the same major version number.

# The "patterns" attribute defines one or more structures that we use to build
# more complex structures. Typically, schemas will define low-level constructs
# first, and then develop higher-level constructs from those building blocks.
patterns:
  
  # A schema_id may not be desirable for schema fragments -- but it is highly
  # recommended for standalone, complete schemas. It gives schemas an
  # unambiguous identity across versions, locations, and name changes.
  # Must be compared case-insensitive and with all punctuation ignored.
  - schema_id:
    # format is compliant with RFC 4122
    regex: /^(?i)[a-f0-9]{8}-?([a-f0-9]{4}-?){3}[a-f0-9]{12}$/
    
  # Using semantic versioning to track evolution is a schema best practice;
  # see http://semver.org. Must be compared case-insensitive.

  # The major building block of all schemas is a node_def. It can be used for
  # a full schema, or any subtree thereof.
  - node_def:
    # A node_def is a map (although the structure it describes may be almost
    # anything). Here we list the names and semantics for any keys that
    # it may contain.
    keys:
      # It is possible to explicitly declare the data type for a node. Often
      # this is unnecessary, though, because some other attribute of the node
      # implies its type. For example, nodes that have a "keys" attribute
      # are maps; nodes that have an "items" attribute are sequences. Valid
      # values for type are yaml datatypes from its core or json schemas, as
      # well any key in the patterns section of the schema, or a uri that
      # grafts in another schema at this location.
      - type: str
      # If a node_def contains a key named "items", the node being defined is a
      # yaml sequence, and the value of "items" is a node_def that stipulates
      # structure of all items in the sequence. 
      - items: node_def
      # If a node_def contains a key named "keys", the node being defined is a
      # yaml map, and the value of "keys" is a sequence of node_def items
      # that the map may hold. Keys are optional by default; this can be
      # overridden with the "required_keys" list (see below). Notice that we
      # are inside the "keys" key of a node_def right now, so we used this
      # pattern to get here...
      - keys: seq
      # If a node_def contains a key named "fields", the node being defined is
      # a tuple (represented as a yaml sequence), and the value of "fields" is
      # a sequence of node_def items that provides names and semantic rules
      # for the fields of the tuple. Unlike a map, fields in a tuple are
      # ordered and are accessed by position rather than by key. Unlike a
      # sequence, where schema constraints apply identically to all items,
      # each field in a tuple has a distinct meaning.
      #
      # Tuples may be "ragged" (variadic) in two ways. Trailing fields may be
      # be omitted by declaring only some of the fields to be required (see
      # "required" below). Alternatively, the "extras" property may be defined,
      # which allows any number of fields to be tacked on to the end of a
      # tuple, as long as the extra fields do not need individualized schema
      # constraints.
      #
      # One use case for "fields" is to define columns in a table. In this
      # scenario, the parent of the node_def that contains "fields" would
      # usually define some type of sequence to represent "rows".
      - fields: seq
      # Lists (by name) keys or fields that were defined in their respective
      # "keys" or "fields" section, and that must appear. All others are
      # optional.
      - required: seq
      # If a node_def contains a key named "regex", then the node it defines
      # has string values. The regex constrains them. It must match somewhere
      # in the value (like grep); to force it to match the full value, begin
      # the regex with ^ and end it with $.
      - regex: str
      # For scalars that sort, this is the smallest acceptable value. No type
      # is specified, meaning that the definer of a schema can use it with any
      # type that makes sense.
      - min
      # For scalars that sort, this is the exclusive min--the largest value
      # that is less than what's acceptable. For example, floating point
      # ratios that must be greater than 0 would declare an xmin of 0.0.
      - xmin
      # For scalars that sort, this is the largest acceptable value.
      - max
      # For scalars that sort, this is the exclusive max--the smallest value
      # that is greater than what's acceptable.
      - xmax
      # An upper bound on length. This may be used with any data type that has
      # an integral length: strings, sequences, maps, sets, and so forth.
      - max_length: int
      # A lower bound on length.
      - min_length: int
      # Require that a numeric value be a multiple of some smaller factor.
      - multiple_of: int
      # This may be included to illustrate valid values.
      - examples: seq
      # A value that should be assumed for the node, if none is provided.
      - default
      # If a node is a container (a sequence, a map, an enum, etc), this key
      # defines how extra members are handled. If "extras" does not appear,
      # then extra members are disallowed.
      - extras: node_def
      # This is not used in validation, but it provides a way to associate
      # human-friendly explanation with each major node in a schema. Unlike
      # comments, tools that work with the schema may use this property to
      # coach users.
      - description: str
      # This is a way to add machine-friendly metadata to a particular subset
      # of the schema. For example, certain parts of the schema could be
      # tagged as "advanced" or "experimental". Each tag is a short string.

      # schema unless the first alpha in the tag is 'x'.
