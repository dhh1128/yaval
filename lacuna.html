<p>A <em>lacuna</em> is a semantic gap--a place where you can express an idea in one language, but not
another.</p>
<p>Formal languages (e.g., schemas, programming languages) all have a <em>lacuna humana</em> in that their scope
of concern is limited to just those issues that will be computed against--they don't express semantics of concern
to human behavior with respect to the code. For example, name a programming language or a data/serialization format
that lets you mark a section of content as "not ready for prime time" (or "needs more tests" or "possibly
contaminated by IP issues" or "addresses requirement X from document Y", etc). Comments don't count, and
annotations aren't quite sufficient, for reasons that I explore in greater detail in a
<a href="https://codecraft.co/2014/07/16/lacunas-everywhere/" target="external">series of blog posts.</a></p>
<p>Most of the time, this gap doesn't bother us, because we solve human problems on our own, and leave
dull computing to the code. The two worlds don't mingle, and that's okay.</p>
<p>But sometimes, we want to do something more ambitious...</p>
<p>Recently, I wanted to create threat models for a large collection of independent codebases. In each
codebase, I wanted the threat model doc to be machine-parseable, and I wanted it to include certain key info such as
a list of actors in the system and a list of potential abuse cases. I wanted the threat models to hyperlink
to pieces of code that were especially interesting. And I wanted my build system to enforce the correctness
of each threat model and its hyperlinks. Plus, over time, I wanted to raise the bar on the threat models,
(not necessarily at the same time for each codebase), requiring additional layers of detail. I also wanted
to mark certain subsets of the threat model as being owned by a particular person or group, or as requiring
committee review, etc.</p>
<p>YAML was an obvious choice for the format of my threat model docs, I could see how a YAML schema
validator would give me most of what I wanted. But I couldn't see how to add the extra layer of semantics
that would let me compute dynamic subsets of the docs that required attention from a specific person, or
that created or satisfied hyperlinkable requirements.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that I might get close to what I needed if I could tag certain yaml nodes with
extra semantics. Think of social media hashtags: if I could write a schema where a particular subsection
was marked with <code>#requiredforbeta</code>, and if, as I approached beta, my schema validator could
be told to start enforcing that docs contained that subsection, I would be close.</p>
